      <h2>Destination Name</h2>
      <img src="C:\Users\MARYAM\Desktop\GROUPPROJECT\Masjid_Wazeer_Khan_Lahore.jpg" alt="Destination Image">
      <h3>About Destination 1</h3>
      <p>The Wazir Khan Mosque (Punjabi, Persian, Urdu: مسجد وزیر خان ; Masjid Wazīr Khān) is a 17th-century mosque located in the city of Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab. 
        The mosque was commissioned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a part of an ensemble of buildings that also included the nearby Shahi Hammam baths. 
        Construction of Wazir Khan Mosque began in 1634 C.E., and was completed in 1641.
        It is on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.
        Considered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque, Wazir Khan Mosque is renowned for its intricate faience tile work known as kashi-kari, as well as its interior surfaces that are almost entirely embellished with elaborate Mughal-era frescoes. 
        The mosque has been under extensive restoration since 2009 under the direction of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Government of Punjab, with contributions from the governments of Germany, Norway, and the United States.</p>
      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>The mosque is located in the Walled City of Lahore along the southern side of Lahore's Shahi Guzargah, or "Royal Road," which was the traditional route traversed by Mughal nobles on their way to royal residences at the Lahore Fort. 
        The mosque is situated approximately 260 metres west of the Delhi Gate, where the mosque's Shahi Hammam is located. 
        The mosque also faces a town square known as Wazir Khan Chowk, and the Chitta Gate. 
        The mosque hosts the shrine of Saint Sakhi Saif Souf.</p>
      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>The mosque is built on an elevated plinth, with the main portal opening onto the Wazir Khan Chowk. 
        The outer perimeter of the Wazir Khan Mosque measures 279 feet (85 m) by 159 feet (48 m), with the long axis parallel to the Shahi Guzargah. 
        It was built with bricks laid in kankar lime.
        <h4>Decorative elements</h4>
        Wazir Khan mosque is renowned for its elaborate embellishment in a style which draws from the decorative traditions from several regions. 
        While other monuments in Lahore from the Shah Jahan period feature intricate kashi-kari tile work, none match the enormous scale of the Wazir Khan Mosque.
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        Bricks facing the mosque's exterior are richly embellished with the Persian-style title work known as kashi-kari. 
        Façades facing the inner courtyard are richly embellished with motifs and palette which display strong influences from 17th century Persia.[citation needed] Persian-style colours used include lajvard (cobalt blue), firozi (cerulean), white, green, orange, yellow and purple,
        while Persian-influenced motifs include star-shaped flowers and grapevines.
        The mosque also contains motifs of cypress trees, and is the first Mughal monument to have borrowed this motif from Persia.
        
        The main prayer hall is richly embellished with Mughal frescoes.
        The façade of the entry portal facing Wazir Khan Chowk is decorated with elaborate tile work and calligraphy that includes verses of the Quran, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, prayers for the Prophet, and calligraphic insignias.
         Above the iwan entrance to the main prayer hall are verses from the Quran's surah Al-Baqara written by the calligraphist Haji Yousaf Kashmiri.
        
        <h4>Frescoes</h4>
        Unlike the contemporary Shah Jahan Mosque in Sindh, the interior walls of Wazir Khan Mosque are plastered and adorned with highly detailed buon frescoes
         The interior decorative style is unique for Mughal-era mosques, as it combines imperial Mughal elements with local Punjabi decorative styles.
          The main prayer hall contains a square pavilion over which the mosque's largest dome rests - a Persian form known as Char Taq.
           The underside of the dome feature frescoes depicting trees in pairs, pitchers of wine, and platters of fruit, which are an allusion to the Islamic concept of Paradise.
        
        <h4>Architectural embellishments</h4>
        
        Several archways in the mosque are decorated with muqarnas.
        The arched niche at the mosque's entrance facing Wazir Khan Chowk is richly decorated with floral motifs, and features one of Lahore's first examples of a muqarna - an architectural element found at the Alhambra in Spain, as well as on several imperial mosques in Iran.
        The low domes over the prayer hall reflect the style of the earlier Lodi dynasty, which ruled Lahore prior to the Mughal era.</p>
      <h3>Conservation</h3>
      <p>The mosque complex is listed on the Protected Heritage Monuments of the Archaeology Department of Punjab.
         In 1993 the site was added to UNESCO's tentative list for World Heritage Site status.
          In 2004, the Government of Punjab embarked on conservations and restoration efforts for the mosque.
           In 2007, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture partnered with the Government of Punjab to restore the monument, and in 2009 began a two year long in-depth survey of the mosque as part of a larger effort to restore the Walled City of Lahore.
            In 2015, the site was mapped in 3D through a partnership between the Lahore University of Management Sciences and the United States Agency for International Development.
        
        <h4>Restoration</h4>
        Restoration works at Wazir Khan Mosque began in 2004.
        In 2012, the Pilot Urban Conservation and Infrastructure Improvement Project—the Shahi Guzargah Project was launched by the Government of Punjab and the Aga Khan Trust for culture which restored a section of Shahi Guzargah between the mosque and Delhi Gate.
         The project was completed in 2015 with support from the governments of Norway and the United States of America.
        
        Prior to completion of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighbourhood. 
        Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. 
        The first phase of the project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. 
        Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored. 
        Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.</p>

        <h3>About Destination 2</h3>
        <p>The Mohatta Palace (Urdu: مہتا پیلس) is a museum located in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. 
            Designed by Muhammad komail Hussain, the palace was built in 1927 in the posh seaside locale of Clifton as the summer home of Shivratan Mohatta, a Hindu Marwari businessman from what is now the modern-day Indian state of Rajasthan. 
            The palace was built in the tradition of stone palaces of Rajasthan, using pink Jodhpur stone in combination with the local yellow stone from nearby Gizri. 
            Mohatta could enjoy this building for only about two decades before the partition of India, after which he left Karachi for the new state of India.
        <h4>Background</h4>
        Shivratan Chandraratan Mohatta was a Hindu Marwari businessman, who traced his roots in Bikaner, Rajasthan, his recorded ancestry began with Motilal Mohata (spelled Mohatta in English), who migrated in 1842 from Bikaner to Hyderabad (in Telangana, India) to become a clerk in a shop.
         His four children migrated to Calcutta and became leading merchants of imported cloth. 
         One of them, Govardhan Mohta, moved to Karachi in 1883. 
         His older son, Ramgopal, became a scholar and author.
         Karachi's Hindu Gymkhana building, officially known as the Seth Ramgopal Goverdhandas Mohatta Hindu Gymkhana was named after this son.
        Govardhan Mohta's younger son Shivrattan became an industrialist in Karachi, and made his fortune from the manufacturing of palm olive soap.
        <h4>Museum</h4>
        In 1995 it was purchased by the Government of Sindh for its conversion into a museum devoted to the arts of Pakistan. 
        The Government of Sindh took over ownership of the property and appointed an independent board of trustees headed by the Governor to formulate recommendations on how best to adapt and use the palace.
         A trust was established to manage the property and ensure that it would not be sold or utilized for commercial or any purpose other than that stipulated in the trust deed.
          Funds for the acquisition of collections for the museum and the construction of an extension are continuously raised by the trustees through private and public grants, donations, and other fundraising activities. 
          Mohatta Palace Museum formally opened in 1999. 
          Next to the main building can be found a small collection of "English" statues which once stood proudly at key public locations in Karachi but flamed public fury during political turmoil in 1960-61.
           Some statues, notably the ones of Queen Victoria and soldiers of the Raj, were damaged during the turmoil.
